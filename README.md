# biorxiv-title-bot

Repo that powers the [@biorxivtitlebot](https://twitter.com/biorxivtitlebot) bot. This bot generates scientific article titles and is trained on titles scraped from [Biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) (hence the name). It does so in a serverless setting by taking advantage of scheduled Github Actions.
